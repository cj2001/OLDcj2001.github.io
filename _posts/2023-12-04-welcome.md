I have been working in data science for more than 22 years.  During that time I have worked in many places, spoken and many conferences, and met many people working in the field.  Patterns started to emerge in my conversations with them on how their business were trying to become data driven and creating data products and solutions.  One of the biggest patterns I saw was that many of these companies and organizations were stuck trying to figure out how to go from A to B.  They had funded the creation of teams and not gotten the ROI they expected.  They were trying to make data-driven decisions but were frustrated by the actual lack of data.  The upper leadership never fully developed trust in the data and would still make decisions based off of intuition.

Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
