I am currently a graph data science advocate at Neo4j, working to expand the community of data scientists and machine learning engineers using graphs to solve challenging problems.  I have been working in data science, machine learning, and related fields of signal processing for a variety of employers (startups, academia, and the federal government) since obtaining my PhD in 2002.  In addition to my work at Neo4j, I founded a company, La Neige Analytics, whose purpose is to provide data science expertise to the ski industry.  I have also authored 4 book chapters, over 20 peer-reviewed papers, and more than 30 conference papers.  Lastly, I was the recipient of the DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2014 and the American Nuclear Society's Mary J. Oestmann Professional Women's Achievement Award in 2015.c
